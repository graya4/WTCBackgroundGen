Basic Python Script that converts images into those used in Ryukishi07's When They Cry sound novels. It isn't PERFECT, but it's close enough.

In order to run, install the requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Then do "python.exe convert.py [your image]"

The resulting image should be outputted as "output.txt"
